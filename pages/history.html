                <p>
                    <strong>Color theory</strong> is rooted in <abbr title="the ancient past">antiquity</abbr>, with
                    early
                    <abbr title="a period of reflection or thought">musings</abbr> on color in Aristotle's (d.
                    322&nbsp;BCE)
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Colors">On Colors</a>
                    and Claudius Ptolemy's (d. 168&nbsp;CE) <a

                    The influence of light on color was investigated and revealed further by al-Kindi
                    (d.&nbsp;873) and
                    Ibn
                    al-Haytham (d.&nbsp;<time datetime="1039">1039</time>).

                    discovered that contrary to the teachings of Aristotle, <strong>there
                        are multiple
                        color paths to get from black to white</strong>. More modern approaches to color theory
                    principles
                    can be found
                    in the writings of Leone Battista Alberti

                    The RYB primary colors became the foundation of 18th-century theories of color vision, as the
                    fundamental
                    sensory
                    qualities that are blended in the perception of all physical colors, and conversely, in the
                    physical
                    mixture
                    of
                    pigments or dyes.
                <p>These theories were enhanced by 18th-century investigations of a variety of
                    purely
                    psychological
                    color effects, in particular the contrast between "complementary" or opposing hues that are
                    produced
                    by
                    color
                    afterimages and in the contrasting shadows in colored light.
                </p>
                <p>

                    These ideas and many personal color
                    observations were
                    summarized in two founding documents in color theory: the <a

                <h2>CMYK</h2>
                <p>
                    Across the same period, industrial chemistry radically expanded the color range of lightfast
                    synthetic
                    pigments,
                    allowing for substantially improved saturation in color mixtures of dyes, paints, and inks. It
                    also
                    created the
                    dyes
                    and chemical processes necessary for color photography. As a result, three-color printing became
                    aesthetically
                    and
                    economically feasible in mass printed media, and the artists' color theory was adapted to
                    primary
                    colors
                    most
                    effective in inks or photographic dyes: cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY).
                    <i>
                        (In printing, dark
                        colors
                        are
                        supplemented
                        by black ink, known as the CMYK system; in both printing and photography, white is provided by
                        the
                        color
                        of the
                        paper.)</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These CMY primary colors were reconciled with the RGB primaries, and subtractive color
                    mixing
                    with
                    additive
                    color mixing, by defining the CMY primaries as substances that absorbed only one of the retinal
                    primary
                    colors:
                    cyan
                    absorbs only red (-R+G+B), magenta only green (+R-G+B), and yellow only blue-violet (+R+G-B).
                    It
                    is
                    important to
                    add
                    that the CMYK, or process, color printing is meant as an economical way of producing a wide
                    range of
                    colors for
                    printing, but is deficient in reproducing certain colors, notably orange and slightly deficient
                    in
                    reproducing
                    purples. A wider range of colors can be obtained with the addition of other colors to the
                    printing
                    process, such
                    as
                    in Pantone's Hexachrome printing ink system (six colors), among others.
