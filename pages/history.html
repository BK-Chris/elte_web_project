                Color theory is rooted in antiquity, with early musings on color in Aristotle's (d. 322 BCE) On Colors
                and Claudius Ptolemy's (d. 168 CE) Optics. The influence of light on color was investigated and revealed
                further by al-Kindi (d. 873) and Ibn al-Haytham (d. 1039). Ibn Sina (d. 1037), Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (d.
                1274), and
                Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253) discovered that contrary to the teachings of Aristotle, there are multiple
                color paths to get from black to white. More modern approaches to color theory principles can be found
                in the writings of Leone Battista Alberti
                (c. 1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1490).

                    Goethe's color wheel from his 1810 Theory of Colours
                    The RYB primary colors became the foundation of 18th-century theories of color vision, as the
                    fundamental
                    sensory
                    qualities that are blended in the perception of all physical colors, and conversely, in the physical
                    mixture
                    of
                    pigments or dyes. These theories were enhanced by 18th-century investigations of a variety of purely
                    psychological
                    color effects, in particular the contrast between "complementary" or opposing hues that are produced
                    by
                    color
                    afterimages and in the contrasting shadows in colored light. These ideas and many personal color
                    observations were
                    summarized in two founding documents in color theory: the Theory of Colours (1810) by the German
                    poet
                    Johann
                    Wolfgang von Goethe, and The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast (1839) by the French industrial
                    chemist
                    Michel
                    Eugène Chevreul. Charles Hayter published A New Practical Treatise on the Three Primitive Colours
                    Assumed as
                    a
                    Perfect System of Rudimentary Information (London 1826), in which he described how all colors could
                    be
                    obtained from
                    just three.

                    Rudimentary
                    Information by Charles Hayter
                    Subsequently, German and English scientists established in the late 19th century that color
                    perception
                    is best
                    described in terms of a different set of primary colors—red, green and blue-violet (RGB)—modeled
                    through
                    the
                    additive mixture of three monochromatic lights. Subsequent research anchored these primary colors in
                    the
                    differing
                    responses to light by three types of color receptors or cones in the retina (trichromacy). On this

                    quantitative description of the color mixture or colorimetry developed in the early 20th century,
                    along
                    with a
                    series of increasingly sophisticated models of color space and color perception, such as the
                    opponent
                    process

                    Across the same period, industrial chemistry radically expanded the color range of lightfast
                    synthetic
                    pigments,
                    allowing for substantially improved saturation in color mixtures of dyes, paints, and inks. It also
                    created the
                    dyes
                    and chemical processes necessary for color photography. As a result, three-color printing became
                    aesthetically
                    and
                    economically feasible in mass printed media, and the artists' color theory was adapted to primary
                    colors
                    most
                    effective in inks or photographic dyes: cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY). (In printing, dark colors
                    are
                    supplemented
                    by black ink, known as the CMYK system; in both printing and photography, white is provided by the
                    color
                    of the
                    paper.) These CMY primary colors were reconciled with the RGB primaries, and subtractive color
                    mixing
                    with
                    additive
                    color mixing, by defining the CMY primaries as substances that absorbed only one of the retinal
                    primary
                    colors:
                    cyan
                    absorbs only red (-R+G+B), magenta only green (+R-G+B), and yellow only blue-violet (+R+G-B). It is
                    important to
                    add
                    that the CMYK, or process, color printing is meant as an economical way of producing a wide range of
                    colors for
                    printing, but is deficient in reproducing certain colors, notably orange and slightly deficient in
                    reproducing
                    purples. A wider range of colors can be obtained with the addition of other colors to the printing
                    process, such
                    as
                    in Pantone's Hexachrome printing ink system (six colors), among others.

                    Munsell's 1905 color system represents colors using three color-making attributes, value
                    (lightness),
                    chroma,
                    and
                    hue.
                    For much of the 19th century artistic color theory either lagged behind scientific understanding or
                    was
                    augmented by
                    science books written for the lay public, in particular Modern Chromatics (1879) by the American
                    physicist Ogden
                    Rood, and early color atlases developed by Albert Munsell (Munsell Book of Color, 1915, see Munsell
                    color
                    system)
                    and Wilhelm Ostwald (Color Atlas, 1919). Major advances were made in the early 20th century by
                    artists
                    teaching
                    or
                    associated with the German Bauhaus, in particular Wassily Kandinsky, Johannes Itten, Faber Birren
                    and
                    Josef
                    Albers,
                    whose writings mix speculation with an empirical or demonstration-based study of color design
                    principles.
