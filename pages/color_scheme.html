            <h1>Color Scheme</h1>
            <article>In screen design, designers use the additive color model, where red, green and blue are the primary
                colors. Just as you need to place images and other elements in visual design strategically, your color
                choices should optimize your users' experience in attractive interfaces with high usability. When
                starting your design process, you can consider using any of these main color schemes...

                            Use three colors located beside one another on the color wheel (e.g., orange, yellow-orange
                            and
                            yellow to show
                            sunlight). A variant is to mix white with these to form a “high-key” analogous color scheme
                            (e.g.,
                            flames).

                            Take three equally distant colors on the color wheel (i.e., 120° apart: e.g.,
                            red/blue/yellow).
                            These colors may
                            not be vibrant, but the scheme can be as it maintains harmony and high contrast. It's easier
                            to
                            make

                            appealing designs with this scheme than with a complementary scheme.

                            Take four colors that are two sets of complementary pairs (e.g., orange/yellow/blue/violet)
                            and
                            choose one
                            dominant color. This allows rich, interesting designs. However, watch the
                            balance between warm and cool colors.

                            A variant of tetradic; you find four colors evenly spaced on the color wheel (i.e., 90°
                            apart).
                            Unlike tetradic,
                            square schemes can work well if you use all four colors evenly.

                Your colors must reflect your design's goal and the brand's personality. You should also apply color
                theory to optimize a positive psychological impact on users. So, you should carefully determine how the
                color temperature (i.e., your use of warm, neutral and cool colors) reflects your message.
